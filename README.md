 <b>Bridging the Gap in Medical Facilities</b> 
</h3>

<br/>

Sehatyaab is an app that connects people in remote or underserved areas with healthcare providers through telemedicine. This could help improve access to healthcare services, especially in areas with limited medical facilities such as villages.

## Features

- **Appointment Scheduling**: Patients can easily schedule appointments with doctors based on their availability.
  
- **Chat Between Doctors and Patients**: Seamless communication between doctors and patients for consultations and follow-ups.
  
- **Login and Sign up for Patients and Doctors**: Secure authentication for both patients and doctors to access the app's features.
  
- **Payment Feature**: Enable secure transactions for doctor fees to ensure seamless payment processing.

## Folder Structure

- **Feature-based Organization:** Each feature of the application has its own folder. Inside this folder, you will find everything related to that feature, including components, services, styles, tests, etc.
- **Self-contained Features:** Each folder is self-contained and modular, making it easier to manage and understand the code related to that feature. This approach enhances code maintainability and scalability, as each feature can be developed and tested in isolation.

## Getting Started with Flutter in Android Studio

### Step 1: Install Required Software

1. **Install Android Studio**: Download and install Android Studio from the official website: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

2. **Install Flutter SDK**: Follow the instructions provided on the official Flutter website to download and install the Flutter SDK: [Flutter Install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

### Step 2: Set Up Android Studio for Flutter Development

1. **Install Flutter and Dart plugins**: Open Android Studio, go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Plugins`, and search for "Flutter" and "Dart". Install both plugins.

2. **Set Flutter SDK Path**: In Android Studio, go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Languages & Frameworks` -> `Flutter`. Set the Flutter SDK path to the directory where you installed Flutter.

### Step 3: Create a New Flutter Project

1. **Create New Project**: Click on `File` -> `New` -> `New Flutter Project`. Select `Flutter Application` and click `Next`.

2. **Configure New Project**: Enter your project name, project location, and other details. Click `Next`.

3. **Select Flutter SDK Path**: Verify the Flutter SDK path and select the Flutter SDK version. Click `Finish`.

### Step 4: Explore Project Structure

1. **Understand Project Structure**: After creating the project, you'll see various folders and files in the project directory. Key folders include:
   - `android`: Contains Android-specific code and configuration files.
   - `ios`: Contains iOS-specific code and configuration files.
   - `lib`: Contains Dart code for your Flutter application.
   - `test`: Contains test code for your Flutter application.

### Step 5: Run Your Flutter App

1. **Run on Emulator/Device**: Connect an Android device or start an Android emulator. Then, click on the green play button (Run) in Android Studio to run your Flutter app.

2. **Run from Command Line**: Alternatively, you can run your app from the command line using `flutter run` command from the root of your project directory.

### Step 6: Start Developing

1. **Edit Dart Code**: Open `lib/main.dart` and start editing Dart code to modify your app's behavior and UI.

2. **Hot Reload**: Flutter's hot reload feature allows you to quickly see the changes you've made in your app without restarting it. Make changes in your Dart code and press `Ctrl + S` to trigger hot reload.

### Step 7: Learn Flutter Basics

1. **Explore Flutter Documentation**: Refer to the official Flutter documentation and resources to learn more about building Flutter apps: [Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs).

2. **Join Flutter Community**: Join the Flutter community on platforms like Stack Overflow, Reddit, and Discord to get help and connect with other developers.

That's it! You're now ready to start building your Flutter app in Android Studio. Happy coding!
